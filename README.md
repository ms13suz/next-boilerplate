## About

This boilerplate makes it easier to get up and running with a well-structured Next.js and TypeScript application designed in redux saga pattern. This is based on https://pankod.github.io/next-boilerplate/ (designed in redux thunk pattern).

## Features

next-boilerplate project provides a lot of features out of the box. Here's an overview of the included components and tools.

* **Next.js** - Minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications.
* **Typescript** - Superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces.
* **Redux** - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* **Redux-Saga** - Asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache.
* **Express.js**- A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that handles server-side rendering and integrates with Next.js.
* **Built-in Project CLI**- Create pages, components, actions, reducers with one command by using built-in cli.
* **Sass/Scss** - CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) into regular CSS.
